<h3 class="show">Climate CubeSat Co-Building</h3>
<p class="show">The Media Lab Space Exploration Initiative is driven by an effort to democratize the future of space exploration. As such, we are committed to the development of meaningful community engagement endeavors related to achieving an open and hackable "New Space Age." Beginning in Spring 2018, in an aim to fulfill NASA’s vision of 50 CubeSats from 50 States in 5 Years, we launched our Climate CubeSat Co-building Outreach Program (C3), in which we mentor 20 Boston-area high school students through designing, building, testing, and launching a cubesat that makes climate science and earth-observation measurements.</p>
