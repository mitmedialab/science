<h3>elements</h3>
The Elements project is opening up MIT Media Lab research in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields/" target="_blank" class="sliding black">STEAM</a> learning programs that democratize science in three elemental areas: earth, ocean, and space. 

These creative, Media-Lab style programs will challenge and excite young people as they engage in learning experiences that are anti-disciplinary, interest-based, and hands-on. With an emphasis on access and equity, Elements is reimagining how to inspire young people to be more connected to their local ecosystems.

Elements is a collaborative Media Lab project from ML Learning, OpenAg, Open Ocean, and the Space Exploration Initiative. Each of our three elemental focus areas is based on current Media Lab research.

<h3>ML Learning</h3>
The <a href="https://learn.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank" class="sliding black">ML Learning Initiative</a> believes people learn best when they are working on projects that they are passionate about, in collaboration with peers, within a playful environment that encourages experimentation. With this pedagogy in mind, we design creative learning experiences and communities to open up Media Lab research and expertise to the world.

<h3>Open Agriculture Initiative (OpenAg)</h3>
The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/" target="_blank" class="sliding green">Open Agriculture Initiative (OpenAg)</a> is on a mission to create healthier, more engaging, and more inventive future food systems. We believe the precursor to a healthier and more sustainable food system will be the creation of an open-source ecosystem of technologies that enable and promote transparency, networked experimentation, education, and hyper-local production.

<h3>Open Ocean</h3>
The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-ocean/overview/" target="_blank" class="sliding blue">Open Ocean initiative</a> works at the intersection of science, technology, art, and society to design and deploy new ways to understand the ocean and connect people to it in novel ways, empowering a global community of explorers. Together, we will discover the unknown, the extremes, and the wonder of the sea — because the ocean is for everyone.

<h3>Space Exploration Initiative</h3>
The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-exploration/overview/" target="_blank" class="sliding yellow">Space Exploration Initiative</a> aims to make Space accessible and engaging for millions—and someday billions—of people through the reach of DIY instruments, experiments, sensors, satellites, and ultimately through a new age of space exploration. Space will be hackable. Space will be playful.
